<RelQSubject>TU (Sofia) or Su? Different specialties and a few pop quiz</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Hi, I have a few questions about the two HEIs. I applied with math, but I don't get my success SU for the first wish (although no results have come out yet, I know). So, in essence: I got a computer and software engineering at the Technical University and most likely computer science SU, but I have a dilemma. According to me in my specialty is prettier TU, SU would at an elite University, and also I heard many different opinions such as: ' ' in SU draw good ratings, but you learn nothing ' ' ' or ' in the TU will learn a lot of unnecessary things, but you will have knowledge of your future work (God forbid) ' ' and so on. , I'd love to share what do you think is better and I would love a lot of posts from people who are familiar with universities closely (i.e. have studied there or their children studying there). Thank you!  [smilie=smile3525.gif]</RelQBody>

<RelCText>If you expect the University to learn how to write software, you will be very disappointed. You get root, and in both places. I've worked with people and by SU and LO, it all depends on the extent to which the man was motivated to develop alone, outside the University, and when it was started to learn what works. In the beginning as a trainee, then as a junior, etc. <br/> I don't know who told you that in SU's grades. grades are those who have learned to have them. <br/> <br/> and I goloslovna years ago, I was facing the same choices as you chose, I'm not SU. But I wouldn't if I was choosing and TU. <br/> success!</RelCText>

<RelCText>Hi <br/> overall   SU maybe is a better University and more prestigious, but the base material, and teachers training on computer science is light years better at TU. TU is a specialized University on engineering and computer science, while SU is primarily with humanitarian, which in itself speaks to why such discrepancy? <br/> I am a student at TU, learn something completely different, but I'm still glad I have and a lot of friends who teach at my RRC and more similar courses, learn a lot, it's hard to take the exams, but you know in the end , your diploma is well deserved. :)</RelCText>

<RelQSubject>Question of succession, when I don't know the deceased</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Hi <br/> <br/> I want to ask if anyone was confronted with something like that ... <br/> <br/> sole heir of a woman I don't know real (relatives, but we never had a relationship). She has not left a will or other heirs? <br/> <br/> estate and no credits. There is a private car, which I think was waived by the report and it is not clear where is. <br/> <br/> I know that I have the option to cancel inheritance or to accept it in inventory, but now comes the question: If I want to check what may possibly have had, what should I do? The idea is that before he died was sold " " all his property to the people, i.e. for those things I have no way to fight, but if there was a (minor) sales, it has a chance to have some assets. <br/> <br/> What follows from here? What assets and liabilities can onasledâ ... so far I have checked in the credit register, the registry Agency (for its municipality), Kat and banks. <br/> <br/> are there other institutions where you need to make any checks or to expect surprises. For example, the IRS? NRA?   is there any way to check whether she had any insurance for instance? Any other assets other than property and accounts you know? For what it's worth, she's young, self-locking M6 is not retired, and is not a contract. I think that was fought on the " profession ". <br/> <br/> idea is that people who lived not willing to chat with me, let alone admit to me that &#1117; things to look for any documents or similar. There's no one to give me information, i.e. it must try and if I accept the inheritance get worried, not to get into trouble ... <br/> <br/></RelQBody>

<RelCText>Thanks for the ideas, very useful! <br/> <br/> next week will consult with a lawyer, and I just wanted to finish as many reports before it, to have a clearer idea on consultation. <br/> <br/> To, all documents, death certificate, certificate of heirs, a copy of ID card, etc. are in me, because thank God given up on these to give them (the transcript of the Act and a copy of the LC) due to lack of kinship, it probably wouldn't have let me know about the case.

<RelQSubject>Mask for hair with gas. Questions!!!</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Hi all I have a few questions about hair mask with gas. I am from Varna and wonder of where can I buy gas. I read a lot of topics that this mask is not suitable for women who are bleached. However, I am a blonde hair I wouldn't tease me like the paint falls on the hair. If you do this mask if it will damage the locks, which are blond or not? And I would like to ask also what are the proportions of this kind of mask. Overall, I'm very grateful to share your experience with such gas masks. I use it mainly for recovery and growth.

<RelQBody>What is the case-I have two cats: male and female. The female has two and a half years and castrated. The male is 9 months. It's our fault we studied how they coexisted both animals. We received advice that it was not appropriate, but we had them already. Our boy is already a grown cat, harassing Princess, mark  , aggressive, no stroking. I think the very presence of the feminine stimulates it. I know that the best option was to be castrated, but I don't want to. I don't want, because according to half of vets, we talked to, is still small. Others say that now is the time. Kotak″t is a large breed, I know that he still has to grow. Sooner or later he's going to lie down under the knife, but when to do this? I have a few takers for the generation of it, but at the moment is small to try to do things like that, right? I looked for info around the net, but I have not found anything concrete. that only depends on the breed, whether grown indoors, etc please give me any advice ... <br/> Please don't criticize me for not doing the deal in advance. enough me hate that I put in this movie.</RelQBody>

<RelCText>Отдавна е доказано, че при женските хапчетата и инжекциите против разгонване водят до ракови образувания на млечните жлези и до кисти в матката. Предполагам, че и при мъжките имат подобни въздействия. При женските разгонването продължава броени дни и затова "помагат" медикаментите. Мъжките са винаги разгонени. Някак не върви месеци наред да им се дават отрови.  <br/><br/>Не мисля, че кастрирането ще попречи на растежа, но ти си знаеш. Имай предвид, че колкото ветеринари попиташ, толкова различни мнения ще получиш.  ;-) Иначе в Америка практиката е, че от приютите не бива да се взимат некастрирани животни и минават "под ножа" още на 2-3 месечна възраст.

<RelCText>Well, that's a little too. Bleach is another thing as well as ksilola (I was surprised that there are people who enjoy this poison). To clear your home with cleaner under is not scary. Just avoid anything that has bleach in it, as all preparations against mold, these drain cleaner (they have a sodium hydroxide fumes are super harmful).

My wife does not understand these things and not paying very much attention and is also her mother and not mind very much unlike me  :D Am I wrong or is this a lot of eating, I feel something is hardly helpful to eat as the world considering that is 1 year old and 8 m last night, gave him to eat a plate of pasta with a Chutney of which even I would be well fed, for lunch when the grandmother was at work with his take from a kitchen in the Manger and give him what for day with half a slice of bread and eating dessert, it always eats it whole:)   By t″pkane so we can't give him milk and many wanted it, I see him like a balloon and afraid to give him milk, water is true but it has no place in my belly now, tomorrow I'm going to tell her, but will listen is another matter, would listen to me, but let's see.</RelQBody>

<RelCText>Thank you for the answers. He eats the whole with a crib, dessert eating it all, but not cooking. Yes, you're right about the milk, you have to give it independent of the other. I am not saying anything against the grandmother, is alive and well with her more than she get along with my daughter, we have no problems, I like doing it and tell her she made me something flit to get it done. For m/y hranenetata gives him another and I don't agree, for fruit and milk I Super agree with you and I will share with the grandmother knows, and I learn a few things from her and she me. Separate living of the grandmother, but we're in the building, and is next door to ours. So not to worry so much, but I'm still going to tell her not to give him another m/y hranenetata in addition to milk and fruit. We get along with the grandmother as I said, I just wanted advice about nutrition, and that she has gone too far overboard, but I'm going to tell and there will be no problems.</RelCText>

<RelQBody>I apologize if my question has commented before, but watching that in the other topics in the ' are entering details, and I'm interested in basic things, because I have no notion of them. <br/> Tomorrow will go on view for a possible change of the ŝrangovete for cold water in a dozen apartments from our block (which total is 5 floors in 3 apartments per floor plus 2 lofts).

I bought the dwelling after renovation last year and at the moment I have neither time nor money, nor desire nor even any ability to deal with breaking down the freshly renovated bathroom.  : tired: before you ask where the pipes pass, there is a šahtička that has a hole on one of the walls in the bathroom-open the door, inside the water meters are visible and part of the pipes that goes up and down. When you open a door, the mesh size is 38 cm 17. Is that where the replacement is made, and whether they will go without broken?</RelQBody>

<RelCText>I have no idea why only the cold-but is written specifically for the note, notify us at the entrance. The Office of the bottom floor had a leak, make major repairs of the dwelling. I guess it has to do with this. Yesterday, I looked around the pipes, as far as I, and I spoke with the former owner-she claims that they changed everything for repair at the beginning of last year and the pipes seem to really have a PVC or something like that (in any case, are not old). Why they have done it without the other neighbours to change their, I have no idea. I hope   But newsm78 really are replaced and the company they don't want anything more than me, because otherwise there are my problems, if I don't want to change right now, and I really don't have an opportunity to do it right now. <br/> but our landlord was a Komsomol Member, ever invent any such initiatives, which require time and money, you make a mess everywhere and finally snapping and it's drama, if someone refuses to participate.

<RelQSubject>Question about replacing the item in-store HYPERMARKET-Burgas</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Hi <br/> I apologize in advance if I don't put the topic on the correct tab. I was looking for similar topics in the search engine, but I haven't been able to find, so I decided to ask <br/> my question is as follows: three months ago I bought a laptop speakers from Technopolis 2 in Burgas. The combos are with 2 year warranty, and thoughtful I saved not only the warranty card, but also the original packaging in which you took them, together with the bags and manual. <br/> <br/> for some time on one column (on which the knob to adjust the volume and on/off) are constantly audible static Crackle, very uncomfortable, like a radio station with a signal and embarrassed though as I watch or listen anything sound is not changed, this noise is also heard and is irritating. Tomorrow I plan to go to Technopolis and want to rotate them, or replace for others at the same price. I agree and if there is no pay exactly the same price, I don't want my money back, I need speakers. <br/> <br/> So I wanted to ask-does anyone know if I have the right to want to rotate them because I'm afraid to not pick and make me leave them there for repair, I really need, and not good enough to wait 30 days period, to tell me that there's nothing they can do (načetoh the terrible experiences of users through the net).  : oops ::p: ray <br/> <br/> and my need for advice is great, because the walking there is related to many other complications-time, time out between other obligations, and I want to know if is worth it to hang out tomorrow? <br/> <br/> please those who have real information-from personal experience in such a case, or know an employee of the store, to tell me how things are with the policy of the store, and it is precisely in this branch, in Burgas because LCP text is very clear: <br/> <br/> art. 124. (1) upon submission of the claim of the product the user can claim a refund of the amount paid for the replacement of the product with another corresponding to the contracted, for rebates or free repairs under the conditions and by the procedure of art. 113 and 114 <br/></RelQBody>

<RelCText>Once purchased from a store, the product is not subject to either the return or replacement, unless we're talking about online ordering. I'm almost convinced. <br/> <br/> all depends on the goodwill of the trader, but in this particular case, I think the odds are on your side. However, we are talking about a period of 3 months (!!!), which assumes that you used the combos. All the way for me, I expect return under these conditions. :shock:</RelCText>

<RelQSubject>Questions about life in Sofia (NBU, Su)</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Hi! I have a few questions related to the NBU, or rather with life around the UNIVERSITY. For over a year, I turned to the educational establishment, however now I met some financial problems and because I'm not from Sofia this can largely confine me. So my questions are: <br/> <br/> 1. Is there a potential opportunity to stand with money in the range of 450-500 EUR for UNIVERSITY? (It comes to upkeep per month with housing or dormitory, but I found that the places awarded, if at all, for the NBU are something like 30 rooms) <br/> 2. Is there a lot of extra costs at the University except semestrialnite fees and textbooks? <br/> 3. All are University " rich " and whether someone with not very high financial capital could fit in the Middle? However, I am going to teach, but also has a major influence environment. <br/> 4. Can anyone tell me the approximate amount of subsistence in Sofia in two versions: <br/>-studying at UNIVERSITY and am relatively inexpensive housing (I'm not familiar enough with the prices of housing and what is the lowest amount for which I can find acceptable accommodations) <br/>-study at SU and I have hosted. <br/> (it comes to indicative amounts for time of the month) <br/> 5. Is it easy to find a part time job as a student in Sofia, such as the second semester, and what are the average payments? <br/> <br/> would ask only for arguments and possibly by people who are or have been in the NBU or SU, or had relatives, friends, etc. in these educational establishments. <br/> thanks!</RelQBody>

<RelCText>The NBU can not give information. A friend of mine teaches her son there, but I don't know how she takes the charges and how he covers the salary (works in shifts, 8-hour working day). His salary was quite high (in the it field is) <br/> my oldest son graduated this year, but not SOO (another University in SF). It was hosted (and I never knew how exactly but approximately 35-40 EUR/month, with supplies, the Internet paid separately). He received 300-350 BGN/per month from us and he said it was good. Some get better with less. His roommates were working and as specialty does not allow many absences from lectures, they drove mainly night shifts. <br/> my little son's first year at Su, works four hours as its working time is fixed (when there is a possibility during the day as long as you have 4 hours), sometimes works all day at the expense of another. <br/> net Money were around $ 100 more than that amount in the first post. <br/> was adopted on campus, but gave up and is on the House. So far, his money is long enough and refused any financial gifts from us.  :) <br/> Hope include other with more accurate information.  :) <br/> success!</RelCText>

<RelCText>I am a student, but in the University of national and world economy. Enough about 350lv per month. But given that I live in a dorm (45-50 EUR per month) and cook it myself. I don't go to discos, etc.  :D (It's not from a financial standpoint, and because discos in studentski Grad rather resemble brothels) of course at the beginning of every semester you're going to need more money for the semester and textbooks (these costs are different for each University). On the UNIVERSITY, I know people who are studying there and not with who knows what kind of financial opportunities, but tegliha student loans to pay for one semester. In addition, do not attend the University particularly often. Or hourly work, which reminds me: you can give away flyers if you know languages, it's best to look for a job in call center, bartender, waiter, many clothing stores at the Mall looking for people on 4-5-hour working day, generally has a choice. <br/></RelCText>

<RelQBody>Hi, ladies! :) <br/> <br/> I need help from those of you who are masters of mekičkite. I've never made, but it's to learn, because I love.

The flavors were good, but a big hell when frying. <br/> so my question is whether the problem was in the dough too soft, with too little flour or something else? I watched the videos on YouTube and there like some grandmothers raztočvaha and not lepneše. And to say that the last weekend I tried the recipe with yeast (dry), but I became more like fritters.

<RelCText>Usually when my sticky dough I add more flour until it's the consistency you need. Add and under the flattening, if it sticks. Another <br/>, I can think of is to do a small hole in the middle. It does not swell and so they look like funnel cakes, and not the fritters.</RelCText>

<RelQSubject>Unanswered questions?</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Hello, long time since I read the Forum as a guest, and your opinions have always been very helpful to me. So now, after I found out I was adopted, I decided to talk to some uncertainties. I read quite a large part of most topics throughout the section on adoption and I think they brought me these questions:D First, in many places, written by you, the term primal wound. I was referencing to Google, but I still don't understand what is meant? Also (forgive me if I'm wrong) I was under the impression that foster be taken as some sort of fellow sufferers or emotionally maimed people that honestly do not understand it and I would love someone to explain to me. I will tell you briefly my story to give you some idea. <br/> I am a girl of 23 years and I found out I was adopted in April this year, quite by accident. It occurred to me somewhere that I've never seen pictures of my mother is pregnant, and we have very many pictures at home since I was a baby, this led to the idea to look at your birth certificate for more closely and noticed that the date on which it was issued is later than usual. So I asked my mom gently, first woman jokingly denied, then froze and confessed. The conversation went relatively easy, I convinced her that there is nothing to worry about and it doesn't change anything for me. After a few months I shared with her that I want to find their biological parents. This term really doesn't work for me, but I'm going to use it, at least in this post. She did not have any documents from the osinovitelnoto case, because my father burned them once more. We were able to find the information, where relevant, where no (if anyone thinks to take such search or just interesting to hear, I think I can be useful and I would explain). Th. .. I don't see anything stunted my emotions here. I have a mother, and I had a father who died a few years ago, I don't need someone else's affection or whatever. The only reason to look for her biological parents is out of pure curiosity. Good day from me:)</RelQBody>

<RelCText>By the decision of the case will determine the names given at birth; in most cases the father is unknown, due to which the child's middle name and family name are the name and surnames of the mother. If you keep the case in court, it should be a declaration by the mother that the child is prepared to be adopted (i.e. at least three names, date and place of birth of the mother). If you know which District Court has become adoption, looking from the archive   in azbučnika for the year under the name of the adoptive parents and you will find the case number.

<RelQSubject>Question ...</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Good evening all! I'm new to the Forum and I apologize in advance if there is a topic on the issue concerned, which worries me. <br/> <br/> my last cycle was on 22nd October. Continue until 28th October. The 31st I had sex with my boyfriend, but he didn't end up in me and outside. It was one of the few times in which we don't use condoms. Normally my period always comes around the 28th day, often early, but almost never late. Alas, this month has not yet come, and I'm already on the 29th day of the first date of the last cycle. Because we want the baby, but at this stage we're not ready for it, I have concerns whether the date 31st has not led to conception, even though by my calculations I was not Ovulating, and overall I had PMS, but not strong, as usual. I read a lot about early pregnancy siptomi, but definitely not a mistake in any of them. Today (day 29) I did a test Sure Check, who expressed clear one feature. I know that there are likely to be late, but it's not like my period already worried and despite negative test continued to torment me doubts. Did I test too soon and how can I trust him? Again, I apologize, but I'm pretty worried.</RelQBody>

<RelQBody>Hi! My child is already one month with coughing, sneezing and coughing between. I brought in three specialists, opinion is that in or allergy or neurogenic (sleep coughing not gram).

<RelCText>The tests for allergies are of three types: scratching with a needle and spotting line/spreads the allergen and tracking response, inhaled IE gives you pomirieš something and be monitored for response and blood, take blood and traces there for some indicators. It is supposed to do when you're not taken anti-histamines/steroids for some time I think that 10 days was) because they suppress the reaction and the test is not particularly faithful as a result. There are no other requirements as far as I know, and I don't see what the risk is, what to him is dangerous, whether you're healthy or sick.</RelCText>

<RelCText>Yes, they are usually the first to make, generally five days are few, I hope correctly reported. <br/> did them to me and I stopped (post-haste was getting reaction) and were inaccurate, it's the only risk in practice. If allergies are an overreaction of the immune system that is not that weak, on the contrary, it's too strong.</RelCText>

<RelQSubject>Questions about the free remediation</RelQSubject>
<RelQBody>Hi. Our block was approved for sanitizing and recently passed a Committee to look at the apartments and asking what people desire. On replacement of vertical and horizontal pipes, we were told that need filling out the Declaration of each apartment. We do not live permanently in this home and today I called a neighbor who informed me that he left a statement which should go to fill. Some things do not have clear and so, before I go to fill out a declaration (a few days), I'd like to consult you. <br/> read my neighbor on the phone, there is a section that reads-" I agree to be replaced all horizontal and vertical risers ". The vertical pipes that go through the ceiling and floor, are actually a replacement, but the horizontal are replaced. I hope, I think correctly, that the horizontal are the ones who start from the meter, enter the wall horizontally and connect all appliances-cistern, fountain, shower, etc.? <br/> I don't know what to say, as the condition reads "-all vertical and horizontal ", and my   horizontal are replaced? If stress-" I agree ", does that mean that I agree to pomenâm   and horizontal when you changed them in the bathroom, repaired a year ago? If you write only " " vertical addition, wouldn't that be considered as a waiver, because I explained that if a person does not agree, nothing will ever be replaced? <br/> way, what I don't understand is, if you need a replacement when breached, we only need to take a repair then? <br/> and what bothers me most is that most neighbors, vertical risers are seen in full, from ceiling to floor. Mine are hidden in a concrete column that has a plastic box with a loophole through which the EE access to water meters. The thing is that this column is hollow inside, and for the most part just cemented the pipes are (for some reason), as is left slightly off in the concrete around the pipe, probably so they can pull from top or bottom flat, if necessary. At least that's what I explained. Do you know of other cases like this just cemented pipes and is it possible two pull without having   big break? My bathroom is new and I don't know what to do.</RelQBody>

<RelCText>" Commission " was actually a design team who went to do the shooting. Declarations are needed to be able to provide for the necessary repair works of each apartment individually. No one is interested in replacing already replaced element – be it window frames, tubes, or other-not the program has an interest to spend unnecessary money, no company-contractor. These declarations shall be taken into account when making technical design for the repair to take account of what and how much is for the replacement. Note that if you have replaced the horizontal pipes and vertical are not, will replace only the vertical. As to whether you'll need whipping, I think nobody can say before to see exactly how it's done. If the tube can be pulled away from the concrete, in principle, can be cut and download, and in its place to put the new, it is flexible and it is not a problem to be a little bit later and enter. Warning-as they cut the old pipes, sparks flying from the saw and you can follow progorât on bathroom tiles, it is better to oblepite all   with corrugated cardboard, for example.</RelCText>

<RelCText>Horizontal pipes are the pipes after the meter, and General pipes in basement (we have and the ceiling), which are horizontal. <br/> had a theme for the remediation and there as far as I remember bistreha question what is assumed in the remediation as repairs. As far as I remember only parts of the building in relation to energy efficiency, because that's the program.   I don't know what to do with pipes to energy efficiency. <br/> <br/></RelCText>

<RelCText>Thank you very much. I did not know that under the horizontal pipes, given the General in the basement. If so, then I can agree without write anything additional. <br/> and I thought free sanitizing covers those parts of the building, which are relevant to energy efficiency. Now, however, I read some interviews with Lilyana Pavlova,   where it says if there are signatures of all apartments will be replaced and ŝrangovete. He even mentioned somewhere and for renovation of corridors and the staircases. <br/> you are doing something without the clarity. Here, suddenly spread declarations in the apartments, s″glesni you with that. In our block is filled with 80 g straci, which first signed. I'm sure most of them hardly realise under what are signed. What is a horizontal, a vertical riser, how exactly will proceed, some people who have not dealt with this, be aware.</RelCText>

<RelCText>There is a blog that I read here: URhttp://www.momichetataotgrada.com/article/kak-stava-saniraneto-edna-zhilishhna-sgrada-po-proekta-za-energijno-obnovyavane.html #. Vmx1scSnJR8 <br/> <br/> man is describing the process, maybe you will find the answers.</RelCText>

<RelCText>2-3 years. in our building and changed our horizontal and vertical risers. <br/> in bathrooms we have as described by the author in the column and reversed their pipes. <br/> Râzaha old with them and they put in their place. Nagrâvaha them with some kind of instrument, they are like plastic. <br/> and pipes in the kitchens were bricked up in the column. Had cut a hole in it, changed them and left us to our own. <br/> 18 floors with holes in the kitchens of the down to the up-beauty. <br/> a neighbor cover it with some drywall and paint on top. <br/></RelCText>
